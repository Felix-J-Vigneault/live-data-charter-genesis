# ADDENDUM: TECHNICAL EVOLUTION

### Protocols & Implementation Blueprints
The following documents constitute the functional execution and extension of the **Live Data Charter**. 
Each protocol addresses a specific pillar of the Architecture of Zero and the transition to the Live Data Dividend.

1. **[The Line of Fire Protocol](./01-line-of-fire.md):** Stateless architecture, RAM-only processing, and the "Snake Strategy" rollout.

2. **[Privacy, Power, Profits: The Lode Revolution](./02-lode-revolution.md):** The LODE Browser Engine and Ephemeral Memory Vault architecture.

3. **[The Architecture of Intelligence](./03-architecture-of-intelligence.md):** The Sapient Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) and mind/reflex separation.

4. **[The Architecture of Zero](./04-architecture-of-zero.md):** The 4 pillars and the codification of the 46.5x Efficiency Dividend and the physics-based JC/EM metric.

5. **[The Water Dividend](./05-water-dividend.md):** Environmental derivations for thermal density reduction and water reclamation.

6. **[Project ÆTHER](./06-project-aether.md):** Physical robotics, magnetic impulse, and movement tokens to apply the Live Data Charter to mechanical systems.

7. **[The Charter - Token Model (Regenerative Industrial Revolution)](./07-charter-token-model.md):** Implementation of the JCEM and 9-factor evaluation system and the new "Social License to Operate" that enforce business accountability and the 70% worker transition mandate.
