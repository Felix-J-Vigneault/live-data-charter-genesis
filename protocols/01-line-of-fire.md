# The First Dividend: A Blueprint (Line of Fire Protocol)

### 1. The Vision - A Strategy
This blueprint affirms that implementing the Line of Fire protocol, created from Live Data Charter principles, will generate the time, resources, and momentum needed for transformative innovation. The objective is a full transition to the live data era: a self-sustaining economy of real-time, ephemeral intelligence architected to re-master time, liberate human potential, and reclaim our cognitive attention.

### 2. The Engine: How Efficiency Funds the Future
This plan is powered by a simple principle: replacing the wasteful "Surveillance Toll" with a tangible "Live Data Dividend." Our models prove the new architecture is 6 to 6.8 times more energy-efficient. For the initial pilot phase alone, this dividend liberates 1.1 to 1.5 GWh of energy and 1.2 to 1.88 million dollars in capital annually.

### 3. The Snake Strategy
A pragmatic, phased rollout designed to achieve full realization within a 19 to 36-month window (mid-2028 from a 2025 start).
* **Months 1-9:** Eliminate systemic overheads, freeing 0.1 - 0.2 GWh.
* **Months 10-18:** Scaling stateless architectures across pilot nodes.

### 4. Technical Core: Line of Fire
The protocol mandates:
* **Stateless Architecture:** No persistent historical profiling.
* **RAM-Only Processing:** Elimination of I/O debt for real-time queries.
* **Ephemeral Intelligence:** Intelligence is processed and discarded immediately after human action is empowered.
