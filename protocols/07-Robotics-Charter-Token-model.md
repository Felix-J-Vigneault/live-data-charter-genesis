# The Charter - Token Model: Implementation of JC/EM, 9-Factor Evaluation and the Social License to Operate

### 1. The Token Model Foundation
The Charter-Token Model is the economic engine of the Live Data Charter.
It is designed to facilitate the transition from a surveillance-based economy to a high-efficiency, privacy-centric model.
It ensures that capital flow is directly tied to systemic efficiency and resource reclamation.

### 2. The 9-Factor Evaluation
All entities, nodes, and participants within the ecosystem are governed by the **9-Factor Evaluation**.
This framework ensures absolute transparency and compliance with Charter principles:
* **Factors 1-3 (Technical):** Efficiency, Statelessness, and I/O Debt Reduction.
* **Factors 4-6 (Economic):** JC/EM Alignment, Value Distribution, and Capital Efficiency.
* **Factors 7-9 (Social):** Privacy Integrity, Social License Compliance, and Provenance Assurance.

### 3. JC/EM Implementation
The **Joule-Cost per Engaged Minute (JC/EM)** is the primary unit of value in this model.
By pegging economic activity to the physical cost of energy and engagement, the model incentivizes the elimination of the "Surveillance Toll" and rewards the generation of the "Efficiency Dividend." **This calculation forms the basis for the issuance and valuation of the Charter Token.**

### 4. The Social License to Operate (SLO)
Access to the Live Data Economy and its associated protocols is contingent upon a verified **Social License to Operate**. 
* **Provenance Audit:** A mandatory 9-Factor audit to verify the origin and intent of all data and capital.
* **Compliance Office:** Continued participation requires a paid subscription and adherence to the Live Data Charter compliance guidelines.

**GOVERNANCE NOTICE:** Commercial use of these protocols without a verified Social License to Operate and a paid subscription from the Live Data Charter compliance office is strictly prohibited and subject to provenance litigation.
