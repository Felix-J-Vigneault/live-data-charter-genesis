Governance & Social License to Operate (SLO)

1. The Charter Mandate
This repository is a technical extension of the Live Data Charter. All activity within this environment—including contributions, forks, and local implementations—is governed by The Live Data Charter framework methodologies and the Social License to Operate (SLO). By accessing this data, you acknowledge that technical efficiency without social accountability is a violation of the Charter.

2. Commercial Use & Derivative Product Restriction
This framework is NOT "free to use" for commercial purposes, nor is it available for the creation of new products, services, or hardware based on this comprehensive architecture without any "Social Agreement Contract" with the author.
Prohibition of Unauthorized Derivatives: You are strictly prohibited from utilizing any part of this repository—including its methodologies, logic flows, and technical benchmarks—to develop, train, or launch any commercial product or service without a verified Social License to Operate (SLO).
License Enforcement: All content is protected under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license. This means you cannot adapt, remix, transform, or build upon the material for commercial purposes since the first publication of the Genesis block.
Non-Commercial Transparency Only: Access to this repository is granted exclusively for the purposes of transparency, public audit, and academic peer-review. This is a "View-Only" and "Audit-Only" grant of access.
Breach of Mandate: Any unauthorized commercial exploitation or productization of the Live Data Charter framework or methodologies, including the JC/EM metric, Stateless AI frameworks, Project ÆTHER protocols, and all derivatives related to it (including The Charter - Token Model / Regenerative Industrial Revolution), constitutes a direct breach of copyright, intellectual property theft, and a violation of the Charter mandate.

3. Binding Conditions of Use
Implementation requires strict adherence to the following:
The 70% Reintegration Debt: Users are legally and ethically bound to allocate 70% of liberated capital and energy (the "Efficiency Dividend") toward worker transition funds. You cannot utilize the Architecture of Zero to simply increase profit margins or stock buybacks.
The 9-Factor Provenance Audit: Every implementation must publish a transparent 9-Factor Evaluation. You cannot "greenwash" efficiency; you are held strictly accountable for the resources you use and how you use or reuse it.
Anti-Extraction Clause: This architecture is designed for the Live Data Charter. Any attempt to use these protocols to build persistent, extractive surveillance databases or "dead data" silos is a direct breach of the License.

4. Contribution & Compliance
Technical Standards: Pull requests must prove a net reduction in I/O overhead. Any code that introduces "Persistence Debt" will be rejected as non-compliant with the Architecture of Zero under the Live Data Charter eco-system.
Forking & Derivatives: Any derivative work or "fork" of this repository remains under the jurisdiction of the Live Data Charter. You may not remove this CONTRIBUTING.md or the associated CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.
Revocation of Rights: Failure to demonstrate compliance with the 70% reinvestment mandate or the subscription requirement results in the immediate and automatic revocation of the right to utilize the Charter’s methodologies, name, or associated intellectual property.

5. Legal Status
This document serves as a "Social Agreement Contract" between the author and the implementer.
Commercial use of these protocols without a verified Social License to Operate and a paid subscription from the Live Data Charter compliance office is strictly prohibited and subject to provenance litigation under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.
